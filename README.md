# csgo-bombtimer
A csgo bombtimer that works with image scanning.  
  
**Note:** This doesn't seem to work anymore since the last CS:GO update when the game is running in Fullscreen mode. Fullscreen Windowed should still work, but only your monitor's native resolution will then be available to play with.
